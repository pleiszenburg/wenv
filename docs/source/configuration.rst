Configuration
=============

*wenv* can configure itself automatically or can be configured with files and environment variables manually.

Files
-----

*wenv* uses ``JSON`` configuration files named ``.wenv.json``. They are expected in the following locations (in that order):

* The current working directory
* A directory specified in the ``WENV`` environment variable
* The user profile folder (``~`` / ``/home/{username}``)
* ``/etc`` (here, the file is simply expected to be named ``wenv.json``)

There is one optional addition to the above rules: The path specified in the ``WENV`` environment variable can directly point to a configuration file. I.e. the ``WENV`` environment variable can also contain a path similar to ``/path/to/some/file.json``.

Configuration options are being looked for location after location in the above listed places. If, after checking for configuration files in all those locations, there are still configuration options left undefined, *wenv* will fill them with its defaults. A configuration option found in a location higher in the list will always be given priority over a the same configuration option with different content found in a location further down the list.

Environment Variables
---------------------

Independently of the ``WENV`` environment variable, all configurable parameters of ``wenv`` can directly be overridden with environment variables. All values coming from configuration files will then be ignored for this particular parameter. Take the name of any configurable parameter, convert it to upper case and prefix it with ``WENV``. Example: The ``arch`` parameter can be overridden by declaring the ``WENV_ARCH`` environment variable.

Configuration via API
---------------------

When using ``wenv`` via its API, it can be configured through its :class:`wenv.EnvConfig` class.

.. _parameters:

Parameters
----------

``arch`` (str)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Defines the architecture of *Wine* & *Wine* *Python*. It can be set to ``win32``, ``win64`` or ``arm64``. Default is ``win32``, even on 64-bit systems. It appears to be a more stable configuration.

.. warning::

	The support for ``arm64`` is experimental and does not receive testing.

``pythonversion`` (:class:`wenv.PythonVersion` or str)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``pythonversion`` parameter tells *wenv* what version of the *Windows* *CPython* interpreter it should use. By default, it is set to ``PythonVersion('{arch}', 3, 7, 4)``.

.. note::

	Windows versions of Python of 3.6 and earlier are not supported. You can only specify versions for which an "*Windows* embeddable zip file" is available, see `python.org`_. Available versions/builds can be queried for using :func:`wenv.get_available_python_builds` and :func:`wenv.get_latest_python_build`.

Release candidate, alpha and beta versions can be accessed in the following form: ``PythonVersion('{arch}', 3, 7, 0, 'rc1')`` (first release candidate). ``PythonVersion('{arch}', 3, 7, 0, 'a1')`` (first alpha version) or ``PythonVersion('{arch}', 3, 7, 0, 'b1')`` (first beta version).

.. note::

	The ``pythonversion`` parameter can also be specified as a string, e.g. ``3.7.4``, ``3.7.0.rc1``, ``3.7.0.a1`` or ``3.7.0.b1``. The architecture is then taken from the ``arch`` field.

``wine_bin_win32``, ``wine_bin_win64``, ``wine_bin_arm64`` (str)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These fields configure the name of the ``wine`` binary/command. They usually depend on packaging and differ across Linux distributions. On Debian- & Ubuntu-based systems, ``wine`` points to Wine 32 bit while ``wine64`` points to Wine 64 bit. Those are also the default settings for ``wenv``. On RedHat/Fedora/CentOS, ``wine`` is by default an alias for Wine 64 bit, however, see `forums at WineHQ`_, and may require additional configuration for ``wenv``.

.. _forums at WineHQ: https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?t=29567

``prefix`` (str)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If ``wenv`` is installed into a *Python* virtual environment or system-wide, this option's default is ``sys.prefix``. If ``wenv`` is installed user-wide, its default is ``site.USER_BASE`` (typically ``~/.local``).

``wineprefix`` (str)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This parameter can be used to point to a custom ``WINEPREFIX`` outside of the ``shared`` folder of the current *Unix* *Python*'s prefix. By default, it is set to ``{prefix}/share/wenv/{arch}``

``pythonprefix`` (str)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This parameter can be used to specify a custom location for the *Wine Python environment* outside of ``wineprefix`` if required. By default, it is set to ``{wineprefix}/drive_c/python-{pythonversion}/``

``winedebug`` (str)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Wine* allows to control the level of debugging output through the ``WINEDEBUG`` environment variable. *wenv* will by default disable all output by setting it to ``-all``. A custom value can be specified in the ``winedebug`` configuration parameter. See the `Wine documentation`_ for details.

.. _Wine documentation: https://wiki.winehq.org/Debug_Channels

``offline`` (str/bool)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If set to ``true``, ``wenv init`` will try to create a *Wine Python environment* from a locally cached *Windows Python* interpreter, a locally cached ``get-pip.py`` script as well as locally cached wheels for ``pip``, ``wheel`` and ``setuptools``. An exception is raised if any of the required components is not found in the local cache. For API usage, a boolean is expected. For command line usage / environment variables, strings equal to ``TRUE``/``True``/``true`` or ``FALSE``/``False``/``false`` are expected. By default, this option is set to ``false``. ``wenv cache`` can be used, while online, to initialize the cache and download all required items.

``cache`` (str)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Path to the local cache directory. By default, it is set to ``{prefix}/share/wenv/cache``.

``packages`` (str)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Path to the local package cache directory. By default, it is set to ``{cache}/packages``. This cache is used for offline initialization of ``wenv`` only, see ``offline`` option. It is not a general offline cache for ``wenv pip``.

``wineinstallprefix`` (str)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Path to custom *Wine* installation. Binaries are expected in ``{wineinstallprefix}/bin``, libraries in ``{wineinstallprefix}/lib`` and ``{wineinstallprefix}/lib64``. If set to an empty string or ``None``, its value is ignored.

``no_pth_file`` (bool)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If set to ``True``, the pth-file within the *Wine Python environment* is temporarily removed and later reconstructed from a backup. This is relevant for prepending ``""`` to ``sys.path`` in CPython >= 3.11 thanks to `CPython PR #31542`_. ``no_pth_file`` allows to work around "Modules/getpath.py sets safe_path to 1 if a "._pth" file is present".
