Running Python on Wine.

User's guide
------------

*wenv* is a **Python package** (currently in development **status 4/beta**). It allows to **run Python on top of Wine** on Linux, MacOS or BSD. It handles required plumbing related to making Python and a number of Python modules work on Wine. `wenv` creates isolated virtual environments which can be transparently used from a Unix command line and which seamlessly integrate into Unix Python virtual environments.
